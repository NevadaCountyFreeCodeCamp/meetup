## About the campers

The Nevada Count Free Code Camp meetup attendees are diverse group of campers, from all walks of life, so attendance varies somewhere between 8-20 people, depending on the season and weather. The week of the event we typically have a decent estimate of the numbers based on Facebook and Meetup event RSVP responses.

## Venue requirements

Below are the basic venue needs to host a Nevada County Free Code Camp Meetup event. 

- Space with tables and chairs for everyone to have room to code
- Decently fast WiFi, that campers can connect to and access the internet
- Outlets for power adapters
- Availability from about 5:00-7:45 pm (the meetup often concules earlier than the posted times) 
- Wheelchair accessibility

Nice to haves (not required!):

- AV equipment, such as a projector or large TV
- Whiteboard
- Beverages (in addition to water) and/or light snacks. Charging a reasonable fee for these extras is ok.
- Public computers that can be used, in the event we have attendees without personal laptops.

We also want to find out:

- Is it ok that the event is open to the public?
- Are there any locked doors or security measures attendees will have to go through to get there?
- What is parking like?

Other research before nailing down a date with the venue:

- Are there any major events happening nearby? Sporting events, concerts, anything else that would make parking and/or traveling to the event a major hassle.
