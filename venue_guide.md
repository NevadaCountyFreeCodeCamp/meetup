Below are the basic venue needs to host a Nevada County Free Code Camp Meetup event. We estimate about 15-20 people in attendance.

- Space with tables and chairs for everyone to have room to code
- Decently fast Wifi that can take a bit of a beating
- Outlets for power adapters
- Availability from about 5:15-8:15 pm ( We  will announce the end of the event at 7:25pm and try to have everyone out by 8pm at the very latest )
- Wheelchair accessibility

Nice to haves (not required!):

- AV equipment, such as a projector or large TV
- Beverages (in addition to water) and/or light snacks. Charging a reasonable fee for these extras is ok.
- Public computers that can be used, in the event we have attendees without personal laptops.

We also want to find out:

- Is it ok that the event is open to the public?
- Are there any locked doors or security measures attendees will have to go through to get there?
- What is parking like?

Other research before nailing down a date with the venue:

- Are there any major events happening nearby? Sporting events, concerts, anything else that would make parking and/or traveling to the event a major hassle.
